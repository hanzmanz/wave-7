# Level 2 Final Project - Personal Budget Tracker

I decided to build a personal budget tracker to better record my expenses throughout the month and identify where my money gets funneled to. I tried my best to include all the JavaScript concepts learnt in level 2 as well as all the required concepts for the level 2 final project:
- DOM manipulation
- localStorage persistence
- responsive design
- API integration
- contact form
- email

Along the way, the feature list grew based on real life requirements and learnt new concepts or found new applications for existing concepts
- generating a summary report using innerHTML
- downloading a .txt file to keep track of budgets for a certain period

Key learnings in addition to the above: 
- Learnt (copied) how to create a summary blob and download it as a text file 
- Learnt you can create functions and later add them on to an event listener using a dedicated function (line 679)
- Learnt how to use display = none/block/flex to make stuff appear or disappear based on the current state
- Learnt to not underestimate reading documentation especially for trying to get APIs to work (only discovered free API limitations after reading more of the official documentation)
- Learnt how valuable console logging is to determine source of an issue which would have saved me hours of struggle.
